In this paper, I develop a rigorous theory of test ideals in mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ based on binary $p$-adic digit patterns. I prove that test ideal membership can be precisely characterized by predicates of the form $\mathcal{P}_\Delta(\binp(x)) = (\val(x) < t_\Delta) \wedge (\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} w_i(\Delta) \cdot \phi(a_i) < C_\Delta)$, where $t_\Delta, w_i(\Delta)$, and $C_\Delta$ are explicit parameters derived from the divisor $\Delta$. Using this framework, I resolve three major open problems: (1) I prove that test ideals commute with completion: $\tau_+(\hat{R},\hat{\Delta}) \cap R = \tau_+(R,\Delta)$; (2) I establish subadditivity: $\tau_+(R,\Delta_1+\Delta_2) \subseteq \tau_+(R,\Delta_1) \cdot \tau_+(R,\Delta_2)$ via a constructive factorization approach; and (3) I unify alternative formulations through explicit predicate modifications. This approach extends classical results from characteristic $p > 0$ and characteristic $0$ settings while providing a computationally effective framework for mixed characteristic algebraic geometry.
