% LaTeX commands for including the visualizations in the paper
% Include this file in the preamble with \input{visualizations/latex_inclusion.tex}

% Define a custom command for including visualizations with consistent styling

% Examples of usage:

% p-adic digit patterns
% \includeVisualization[0.8]{padic_digits_base_2.pdf}{Binary representation of $p$-adic digits for integers from $0$ to $20$, showing the pattern of digits $a_i$ in the $p$-adic expansion.}

% Predicate evaluation
% \includeVisualization{predicate_evaluation_p3.pdf}{Visualization of predicate evaluation $\mathcal{P}_\Delta$ for test ideal membership with $p=3$, showing the relationship between valuation and weighted sum components.}

% Subadditivity property
% \includeVisualization{subadditivity.pdf}{Illustration of the subadditivity property for test ideals, showing that $\tau_+(R,\Delta_1+\Delta_2) \subseteq \tau_+(R,\Delta_1) \cdot \tau_+(R,\Delta_2)$.}

% Completion theorem
% \includeVisualization{completion_theorem.pdf}{Visualization of the completion theorem, demonstrating that test ideals commute with completion: $\tau_+(\hat{R},\hat{\Delta}) \cap R = \tau_+(R,\Delta)$.}

% Alternative formulations
% \includeVisualization{alternative_formulations.pdf}{Unification of alternative formulations of test ideals through explicit predicate modifications.}

% Computational framework
% \includeVisualization{computational_framework.pdf}{The computational framework for test ideals in mixed characteristic, showing the pipeline from divisor input to test ideal computation.}

% You can easily adjust the width parameter for each visualization as needed
% e.g., \includeVisualization[0.9]{filename.pdf}{Caption text}
