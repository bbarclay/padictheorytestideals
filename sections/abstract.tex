In this paper, I present a comprehensive theory of test ideals in mixed characteristic based on binary p-adic patterns. I demonstrate that test ideal membership can be characterized by predicates on p-adic digit representations, allowing for a unified approach to three major open problems: behavior under completion, subadditivity properties, and alternative formulations. By developing a perfectoid factorization theory within this binary framework, I resolve apparent counterexamples to subadditivity and establish a coherent global theory. This approach extends classical results from characteristic p $>$ 0 and characteristic 0 settings, providing a powerful new paradigm for understanding test ideals in mixed characteristic algebraic geometry.
